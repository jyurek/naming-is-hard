      <h1>Phil Karlton</h1>
      <blockquote>
        There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">They're hard because they're not calculable.</div>
    <div class="slide">Code is communication</div>
    <div class="slide">The computer doesn't care what you name a class</div>
    <div class="slide"><img height="100%" width="100%" src="images/bad_code.png"/></div>
    <div class="slide">Even "joke" langauges show that code is written for humans to care about</div>
    <div class="slide">We program for other people</div>
    <div class="slide">We work on teams. We need to communicate.</div>
    <div class="slide">Ideas have power. Names have power.</div>
    <div class="slide">Giving things names helps you think about them</div>

      <h1>Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</h1>
      <blockquote>
        A hypothesis holding that the structure of a language affects the perceptions of reality of its speakers and thus influences their thought patterns and worldviews.

    <div class="slide">We don't work in trivial codebases</div>
    <div class="slide">Know what you're working with</div>
    <div class="slide">If you can't name something, it's probably wrong</div>
    <div class="slide">It might be wrong because you're doing too much</div>
    <div class="slide">Don't try to contain too much in one label</div>
    <div class="slide">Don't be too general</div>
    <div class="slide">"Object" is the only thing that should be "Object"</div>
    <div class="slide">"Base" is bad</div>
    <div class="slide">I worked in a project with a base class of "Datum"</div>
    <div class="slide">WAY too general</div>
    <div class="slide">And won't <b>someone</b> think of the grammar!</div>
    <div class="slide">SRP applies to names, too</div>
    <div class="slide">Something that does one thing will be easier to name</div>
    <div class="slide">20 Lines of Error Handling</div>
    <div class="slide">Extracted error handling was now 5 lines and a class called "SyncErrorHandler"</div>
    <div class="slide"><h1>Sandi Metz's rules</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Classes can be no longer than one hundred lines of code.</li>
        <li>Methods can be no longer than five lines of code.</li>
        <li>Pass no more than four parameters into a method. Hash options are parameters.</li>
        <li>Controllers can instantiate only one object. Therefore, views can only know about one instance variable and views should only send messages to that object (@object.collaborator.value is not allowed).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">Small classes, small methods</div>
    <div class="slide">That means many classes and methods</div>
    <div class="slide">The parts become labelled for you</div>
    <div class="slide">Learn how something works by extracting methods</div>
    <div class="slide">It wasn't a good method</div>
    <div class="slide">Even after extraction, it's a 50 line method called "run"</div>
    <div class="slide">best thing to do is extract methods</div>
    <div class="slide">extracting methods lets you tease apart intent</div>
    <div class="slide">knowing intent lets you apply names</div>
    <div class="slide">applying names tells the next person about the code</div>
    Even small names matter
    Don't ever name something "x"
    Old habits die hard
    I learned on BASIC, and single letters were the rule
