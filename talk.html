    hi, I'm Jon Yurek
    I'm one of the founders of and one of the developers at thoughtbot
    this talk is about naming things
    naming is hard
    there are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things
    they're hard because they're not calculable
    they're human problems
    they're not predictable
    cache invalidation is predicting the future
    naming things is relating to humans
    code is communication
    code is how you talk to coworkers
    code is how you talk to yourself, 3 months from now
    code is how you talk about your domain
    code is how you convey ideas
    computers can run any old shit
    brainfuck exists
    and intercal
    and whitespace
    and lolcode
    computers run that
    but even as joke langauges they show that code is written for humans to care about
    we program for other people
    work on teams, need to communicate
    ideas have power
    names have power
    call a spade a spade
    don't call it a ShovelManagerJob
    extraction is a lot of refactoring
    sandi metz' rules means extractions
    it also means small classes
    and small methods
    small classes and methods mean many classes and methods
    we don't work in trivial codebases
    extraction is key
    know what you're working with
    if you can't test something, it's probably wrong
    if you can't name something, it's probably wrong
    it might be wrong because you're doing too much
    trying to contain too much in one label
    don't be too general
    "object" is the only thing that should be "object"
    "base" is bad
    worked in a project with a base of "datum"
    WAY too general
    AND won't someone think of the grammar!
    SRP applies to names, too
    something that does one thing will be easier to name
